GET and PUT YouTube stats for your video 


When i first watched this [Tom Scott's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxV14h0kFs0&t) video i was very curious how he achieved this. But unfortunately he didn't show or talked about the code in that video.

So that inspired me to replicate the same thing.

This repository contains the exact code you need in order to achieve that.
